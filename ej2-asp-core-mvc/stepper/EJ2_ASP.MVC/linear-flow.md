# Linear flow in ##Platform_Name## Stepper control

The Stepper control enables users to progress sequentially through each step, ensuring navigation from one step to the next in a linear way by setting the [Linear](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Navigations.Stepper.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Navigations_Stepper_Linear) property to `true`. The default value is `false` allowing navigation between any steps and vice versa.

The example demonstrates the functionality of both linear and non-linear flow in the Stepper.
